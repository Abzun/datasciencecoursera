# Code Book for Tidy Data Set

## Overview
This code book describes the variables for  `run_analysis.R` script.

## Transformations and Cleaning
1. **Merging Training and Test Sets**: The training and test data sets were merged to create one data set.
2. **Extracting Mean and Standard Deviation Measurements**: Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted.
3. **Using Descriptive Activity Names**: Descriptive activity names were used to name the activities in the data set.
4. **Labeling Data Set with Descriptive Variable Names**: The data set was appropriately labeled with descriptive variable names.
5. **Creating Tidy Data Set**: A second, independent tidy data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Variables
The tidy data set contains the following variables:

- `SubjectNum`: The ID of the subject.
- `Activity`: The activity performed by the subject, with the following possible values:
  - `WALKING`
  - `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`
  - `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`
  - `SITTING`
  - `STANDING`
  - `LAYING`
- `tBodyAcc-mean()-X`: Mean of body acceleration in X direction.
- `tBodyAcc-mean()-Y`: Mean of body acceleration in Y direction.
- `tBodyAcc-mean()-Z`: Mean of body acceleration in Z direction.
- `tBodyAcc-std()-X`: Standard deviation of body acceleration in X direction.
- `tBodyAcc-std()-Y`: Standard deviation of body acceleration in Y direction.
- `tBodyAcc-std()-Z`: Standard deviation of body acceleration in Z direction.
