# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Overview
This repository contains the R script `run_analysis.R` that performs data cleaning and analysis on the Samsung Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset. 
The script merges the training and test sets, extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation, uses descriptive activity names, labels the data set with descriptive variable names,
and creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the Samsung Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, 
which can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository provided by coursera. 

## Files in this Repository
- `run_analysis.R`: The R script that performs the data cleaning and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
- `CodeBook.md`: A code book that describes the variables in the tidy data set.

## How to Run the Script
1. I tried to set path variables so that anyone can use it to analysis the data too
2. Place the `run_analysis.R` script in your working directory.
3. Open R or RStudio and set the working directory to where the script and data directory are located.
4. Change the paths for your system. 
5. Run the script
